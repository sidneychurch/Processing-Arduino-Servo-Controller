# Processing + Arduino Servo Controller

This was built for a robotics camp. so that the students could get an understanding on servo control but starting with a graphical interface. This also was used a servo debugging tool to make sure their servos were placed and working like they expected.

The Processing sketch utilizes the ControlP5 library, found here: https://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/
