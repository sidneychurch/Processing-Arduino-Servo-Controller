# Processing + Arduino Servo Controller

This was built for a robotics camp so that the students could get an understanding on servo control but starting with a graphical interface. This also was used a servo debugging tool to make sure their servos were placed and working like they expected. It also provides a javax dialog window to easily make sure that you're connected to the correct port for your Arduino.

The Processing sketch utilizes the ControlP5 library, found here: https://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/
